# The Document Object Model (DOM)

Basis of HTML5 is "New features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM and JavaScript"  
DOM provides common tree-like structure that all pages should follow

## HTML Is Built On The DOM

### Three parts of a well-formed document

- Doctype
  - Version of HTML that you will be using
- Head
  - Metadata
- Body
  - Displayable content

## Doctype

- HTML5
- Previous versions dictated backwards compatibility

## Head

- Aditional information used by the browser
  - Meta data - languaje, title
  - Supporting files - JavaScript, Styling
- Other than title, meta-data, is not displayed

## Body

- Bulk of your page
- Important to write well-formatted (tree-like) code
- Most of the content is displayed by the browser, but there may be some meta-data too

### Well-formed pages use the DOM structure

- Use beginning and end tags
- Close inner tags before outer ones
- Use valid attributes

# HTML5 Elements - Tags, Syntax, Semantics and Templates

- Tags have a beginning and an end
- Some tags have attributes (src, href, etc)

## Display

- One of the most important attributes of an element is its display. The two most common are _*block*_ an _*inline*_
  - Block (can take width and height)
  - Inline (can not take width and height)

## Special Entities

| If you want... | Then use |
| :------------- | :------- |
| <              | &lt      |
| >              | &gt      |
| ©              | &copy    |
| black space    | &nbsp    |
| &              | &amp     |
| ¢              | &cent    |

# Semantic Tags

You need a clear picture of what you want to create, before you can begin coding

## Header Tag

A group of introductory or navigational aids: title, navigation links, etc  
Not be consused with `<head>` or the different headings

# What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  
Markup languages are not the same as programming languages, they use tags to annotate documents.  
In HTML the tags indicate where headings, images, lists, links, line breaks, and other components should go.

## .html Files

When your computer opens a .html file, it knows to open it in an Internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)  
The browser can read this file and know how to display it on the screen.
Screen readers and other assistive devices can also utilize the HTML tags to present the information is special ways.

# History and Evolution

HTML(I) was created in 1990 as a way to electronically connect documents via hyperlinks.  
It is required that HTML be a common language between all plataforms. This implies no device-specific markup, or anything  
which requires control over fonts or colors, for example.

## Mosaic

In 1993, Mosaic emerged as the first graphical browser.  
Mosaic had challengers though in the form of Netscape (1994), Internet Explore (1995) and others.

## The Browser Wars.

Browsers had proprietary tags. Tags that only work on the browser.  
Other tags that went against the spirit of the original tenets of HTML.  
Origination of "Best viewed on" messages.

### Web Standards

No one "runs" the Internet or the web, some groups do take proactive roles.
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

| 1995 - 1999 | Cross-Browser compatibility falls apart                        |
| 2000 - 2005 | Browsers move toward separating content from style             |
| 2005 - 2008 | Using HTML files in coordination with CSS becomes new standard |

### Where are now

- HTML5 is a cooperation between W3C and the Web HyperText Application Technology Working Group
- Established Guidelines
  - New features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM and JavaScript
  - Reduce the need for external plugins
  - More markup to replace scripting
  - HTML5 should be device independent
